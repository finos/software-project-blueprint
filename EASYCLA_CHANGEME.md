This file is used to test EasyCLA onboarding.

To get started, [just submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/finos/software-project-blueprint/edit/main/EASYCLA_CHANGEME.md) with a simple change to this file (adding an empty line, or some random text at the bottom); this will trigger the EasyCLA bot, which will post a comment to the Pull Request stating whether all PR contributors are covered by FINOS CLA; if not, the bot will post instructions on how to sign the CLA.

You can read more about EasyCLA on [FINOS community repo](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Software-Projects/EasyCLA.md).
